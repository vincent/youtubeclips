Installation:

Make sure you have either python-gtkmozembed or python-gtkwebkit librairies installed.

Place the plugin in your Rhythmbox plugin folder.
If it doesn't exist then simply create one. Usually it resides here:

~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins

Then activate it. Video results should appear under playlists.
